# 🏀 Ball-O-Mania

A game I created when I was in high school. Built it with [Unity3D](https://unity.com/) game engine.

The game was on the Play Store earlier, but Google keeps updating rules and requires apps to support the latest Android versions. Because I couldn’t keep updating it, the game stopped showing up on the Play Store.

I also don’t have the game’s source code anymore. When I made it, I was very new to programming and didn’t know how to use Git or GitHub properly. I accidentally enabled Git LFS (Large File Storage) without knowing what it was. I made another mistake by moving the project between GitHub and GitLab multiple times. Because of that, all the LFS files got lost — and those files had the actual code.

Luckily, I still have the APK that I downloaded from the Play Store developer console, and I’m attaching it here. Please install it, try playing a few rounds, and tell me if you think it was worth the effort I had put into ito it.
- `Direct APK`: [Download](https://gitlab.com/a0v0/Ball-O-Mania/-/raw/main/apk/ballomania_v1.0.4.apk?ref_type=heads&inline=false)
- `Playstore`: [Download from Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.starland.ballomania) if you have a very old device. Unsure if this link still works.
